# Pitt-Gym-Tracker

## Motivation
Right now, the only way to see counts for Pitt Gym facilities is to go to [this website](https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/campus-recreation/facilities/live-facility-counts)  

I did not know this even existed as a Pitt student, and now that I have seen it, it is not very useful and is unappealing.
